# convert reddit citations to bibtex format
Finds "(reddit.com/r/subforum/)" urls in word document and generates a bibtex file to import, in order to properly cite reddit posts.
Useful for example for paperpile.com, but zotero and so on should work fine too.

# to do:
- use the reddit api legitimately with a key instead of circumventing rate limiting.
